# Prompts Used During Development

This document contains the prompts I used while developing the Tasks Generator application.

## Initial Setup

```
Problem statement A: Tasks Generator (mini planning tool)
Build a web app where I can:

- fill a small form about a feature idea (goal, users, constraints)
- generate a list of user stories and engineering tasks
- edit, reorder, and group tasks
- export the result (copy/download as text or markdown)
- see the last 5 specs I generated
  Make it your own: for example, add templates (mobile/web/internal tool) or "risk/unknowns" section.
  Ensure implementation using React and Flask with proper runnable setup.
```

## PDF Export Issues

```
Fix issue: PDF download showing garbled text with & symbols. Ensure proper user-readable format.
```

```
Error When User Download in PDF File [showing garbled text with &amp; symbols]
its does not include &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; Fix spacing issue in Risks/Unknowns section. Ensure PDF content is justified and properly aligned.
```

## User Story Improvements

```
Under User Stories section, provide accurate stories. Do not repeat; each of the three paragraphs should be distinct.
```

```
Ensure user stories are dynamic and change based on the goal input. Do not keep them static.
```

**Note**: These prompts document the evolution of the application from concept to final implementation.  
They highlight the focus on error handling, validation, documentation, and user experience.  
This file is part of the required documentation set, alongside `README.md`, `ABOUTME.md`, and `AI_NOTES.md`.
